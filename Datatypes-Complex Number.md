# Ex 1d:Conditional Statements-Checking equality of two numbers using a ternary operator.

## Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers and checks whether they are equal using a conditional (ternary) expression.
## Algorithm
1.Start.

2.Read two integers.

3.Compare them using a ternary operator.

4.Display the result.

5.Stop.
## Program
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

result = True if a == b else False

print(result)
```
## Output
<img width="383" height="210" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7def8a0-8e01-4d33-8997-495be428a91d" />

## Result
Thus, the program successfully checks whether two numbers are equal using a ternary operator.
