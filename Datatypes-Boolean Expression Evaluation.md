# Ex 1b:Datatypes-Program to read a tuple and convert it into a list.
## Aim
To write a Python program that reads a tuple from the user and converts it into a list using the eval() function.

## Algorithm
1.Start the program.

2.Read the tuple input from the user using input().

3.Convert the input string into a tuple using eval().

4.Convert the tuple into a list using the list() function.

5.Display the resulting list.

6.End the program.
## Program
```
tuple_input=eval(input())
list_output=list(tuple_input)

print("List=", end='')
print(list_output)
```
## Output

## Result
Thus, the Python program to convert a tuple into a list using eval() was successfully executed and the expected output was obtained.
